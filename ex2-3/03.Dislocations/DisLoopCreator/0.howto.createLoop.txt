# First generate a sample of interest where you would like to introduce a loop
# Here, we generate a single crystal for Al using LEGO
# Have a look at the *.legoparam file - Are there any parameters that you do not understand?
legoV3.1 Al_x110_y1-12.legoparam 

# Now we run the dislocation loop creator (disLoopCreator) ...
# ... using the input file loop_SX_Al.inp
# Take a look at this file - do you understand all the parameters?
# A few points have been pre-selected for the exercise. Try to substitute a few points 
# You can us OVITO to find a few points of interest 
# CAREFUL: ALl points must lie on the same plane! - use cutting planes and narrow down your search!

disLoopCreatorArun loop_SX-Al.inp 

# Now view your structures (with and without dislocation loop)
# Verify that the loop is inserted in the right place...
# ... by opening the structure in ovito. Perform a "Common Neighbor Analysis" and remove all fcc atoms ...
# ... by choosing "Select Particle Type" > FCC, and then using "Delete Selected Particles"
#
# Food for thought:
# 1. Why do we have a defect at the center of the loop?
# 2. Why is the loop not smooth?
# 3. Where is the stacking fault?
#
# Now play around with the tool by ... 
# 1. choosing a larger box and a larger loop size
# 2. choosing a different plane for inserting the dislocation
